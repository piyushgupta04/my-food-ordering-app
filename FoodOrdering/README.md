  # Black Ash Food Ordering System

The Black Ash food ordering system is a database project implemented using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other frontend technologies. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to place their orders and for managers and chefs to efficiently manage those orders.

## Features

- Customers can create an account, log in/out, and browse the restaurant's menu to select items and customize them as needed.
- Customers can add and remove items from their current order and place their orders by providing payment details. They can also select the quantity of each item they want to order.
- Managers can log in/out, maintain orders, send order confirmation to customers in the form of an order number, and send orders to the chef for fulfillment.
- The chef can log in/out, view the food items from orders, and update the order status when the food is ready for take away.

## Database Schema

The system is based on a relational database schema that includes tables for customers, orders, and menu items, among others.

## Frontend Design

The frontend is designed using modern web development techniques and frameworks to provide a responsive (partial) and visually appealing user interface.

## Scalability

The system is designed to be scalable and extensible, with the potential to add additional features and functionality as needed.

## Documentation
